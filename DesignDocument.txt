Design Document: AI-Assisted Video Storytelling MVP

1. Overview
   - The AI-Assisted Video Storytelling MVP is a system that generates short videos from textual input, using AI-generated images, voice, sound effects, and music.
   - The MVP focuses on the core functionality of video generation, without a user interface or editing capabilities.

2. System Architecture
   - The system consists of five main modules: Planner, Voice, Image, Sound Effects, and Movie Builder.
   - The modules work together to process the input text, generate the necessary components, and assemble the final video.

3. Input Data
   - The input to the system is a text file containing information about the scene, characters, setting, and script.
   - The text file should follow a specific template or schema to ensure consistency and ease of parsing.

4. Planner Module
   - The Planner module is responsible for analyzing the input text and creating a video plan.
   - It extracts relevant information from the input, such as character descriptions, dialogue, scene details, and sound effect cues.
   - The Planner generates a YAML document that specifies the structure and timeline of the video, including the durations and file paths for each component (images, voice, sound effects, music).

5. Voice Module
   - The Voice module generates speech audio for the character dialogue specified in the input text.
   - It uses a text-to-speech (TTS) system or API to convert the dialogue text into spoken audio.
   - The generated voice audio files are saved and their file paths are provided to the Planner module for inclusion in the YAML document.

6. Image Module
   - The Image module generates static images for each scene based on the descriptions provided in the input text.
   - It uses a pre-trained image generation model or API to create the images from textual prompts.
   - The generated image files are saved and their file paths are provided to the Planner module for inclusion in the YAML document.

7. Sound Effects Module
   - The Sound Effects module generates or retrieves appropriate sound effects and background music for each scene based on the cues provided in the input text.
   - It uses a library of pre-recorded sound effects and music tracks, or integrates with a sound generation API or tool.
   - The selected sound effect and music files are saved and their file paths are provided to the Planner module for inclusion in the YAML document.

8. Movie Builder Module
   - The Movie Builder module assembles the final video based on the YAML document generated by the Planner.
   - It loads the generated image, voice, sound effect, and music files specified in the YAML document.
   - Using a video editing library (e.g., MoviePy), it combines the images, audio, and sound effects according to the timeline and durations specified in the YAML document.
   - The resulting video is saved to an output file.

9. Error Handling and Logging
   - The system should include appropriate error handling and logging mechanisms to gracefully handle and report any issues that may arise during the video generation process.
   - This includes handling missing files, invalid input data, and unexpected errors in the various modules.

10. Performance and Scalability
    - The MVP should be designed with performance and scalability in mind, even if not fully optimized in the initial version.
    - This includes choosing efficient algorithms and libraries for video, audio, and sound effect processing, and considering potential bottlenecks in the system.

11. Future Enhancements
    - User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface for inputting the text data and configuring the video generation settings.
    - Real-time Editing: Create an editor that allows users to modify the YAML document and preview the changes in real-time before generating the final video.
    - Advanced Media Generation: Expand the system to support more advanced media generation techniques, such as video clips, animations, and dynamic scene composition.
    - Integration with External Tools: Integrate the system with external tools and platforms for additional functionality, such as social media sharing, collaborative editing, and asset management.

12. Development Process
    - The MVP will be developed using an iterative approach, starting with the core modules and gradually adding functionality and refinements.
    - Regular testing and code reviews will be conducted to ensure the quality and reliability of the system.
    - The development process will prioritize the most critical features and components first, while leaving room for future enhancements and optimizations.
